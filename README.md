# Wyndham-Worldwide---Hoseasons

My internship experience at Wyndham exposed me to a variety of tasks. 

One of my tasks involved conducting a performance analysis of a sales policy. Examples of my work is in "Low Deposit Analysis."

To help the call center better manage employee hours, I helped create a tool that helps forecast call volume based on historical data. More
specifically, by predicting call abandonment, managers are able to have a clearer idea of call volume. Completing this involved linear regression,
and then applying the fitted equation into EXCEL via VBA.
